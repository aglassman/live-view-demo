    # NOTE: Running the migration here assumes instances will always be set to 1!
    #       Before scaling up instances to >1, there needs to be a custom mix task
    #       which only runs on first instance.  E.g. `mix cf.ecto.migrate.on_first_instance`
    #       See https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/migrate-db.html
